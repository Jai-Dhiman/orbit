# Arden Project Status

## Project Overview and Goals

Arden is a personal AI assistant designed to help manage daily life through intelligent note-taking, schedule management, emotional support, and accountability tools. The mission is to create an AI assistant that understands user needs, adapts to them, and helps achieve goals while ensuring privacy and security.

## Architectural Rule Adherence

The project aims for a monorepo structure with shared business logic (`/packages/core`) and UI components (`/packages/ui`), and platform-specific applications in `/apps`.

**Current Status:**

*   **Monorepo Structure:** The codebase generally follows the prescribed monorepo structure.
    *   `packages/core` exists with `api`, `hooks`, `state`, `types`, `utils`.
    *   `packages/ui` exists with `components` and `styles`.
    *   `apps/mobile` and `apps/server` exist.
*   **Code Sharing:** Business logic and UI components are being shared from the `/packages` directory.
*   **Naming Conventions:** A quick scan suggests that naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase with `use` for hooks) are generally being followed. For example, `apps/mobile/src/components/StyledText.tsx` and `packages/core/hooks/useCalendarEvents.ts`.
*   **Package Management:** The project uses `bun.lockb`, indicating Bun is the package manager, aligning with the rules.
*   **Styling (React Native):** `apps/mobile` uses React Native. It's not immediately clear from file structure alone if `StyleSheet.create()` is universally used, but `packages/ui/styles/colors.ts` suggests a centralized styling approach.
*   **State Management:**
    *   Zustand is intended for client state. `packages/core/state/notesStore.ts` and `calendarEventsStore.ts` indicate its use.
    *   TanStack Query is intended for server state. `packages/core/hooks/useCalendarEvents.ts` (which likely wraps TanStack Query) suggests its use.
*   **Expo Framework (for mobile):**
    *   `apps/mobile/app.json` exists.
    *   `apps/mobile/app/` directory suggests Expo Router is in use.
    *   EAS Build configuration (`eas.json`) is not present in the root, which is a deviation if EAS Build is a current requirement.

**Potential Deviations/Areas for Review:**

*   **EAS Build Configuration:** `eas.json` is missing. If over-the-air updates or native builds are planned soon, this needs to be set up.
*   **Feature Slicing in Mobile:** The rules specify `apps/mobile/src/features/[featureName]` for vertical slicing. Currently, `apps/mobile/src/` has `components`, `providers` but not a clear `features` directory. This might be an area for future refactoring as the app grows.
*   **MMKV for Persistence:** While Zustand is used, the specific use of MMKV as its persistence layer isn't immediately verifiable from file structure alone and would require deeper code inspection.

## Key Feature Status

Based on `project-details.mdc`:

*   **Intelligent Note-Taking:**
    *   **Status:** In Progress
    *   **Justification:** `packages/core/api/notes.ts` and `packages/core/state/notesStore.ts` exist, suggesting foundational work. AI-powered organization and semantic search are likely future enhancements.
*   **Smart Schedule Management:**
    *   **Status:** In Progress
    *   **Justification:** `packages/core/api/calendarEvents.ts` and `packages/core/hooks/useCalendarEvents.ts` indicate work on calendar functionalities. Natural language processing for event creation is a more advanced feature likely not yet built.
*   **Emotional Support & Growth:**
    *   **Status:** Not Started
    *   **Justification:** No clear codebase evidence (e.g., specific modules, API endpoints, or state stores) for personalized motivation, emotional check-ins, or progress visualization.
*   **Accountability Partner:**
    *   **Status:** Not Started
    *   **Justification:** No clear evidence for adaptive reminders, habit tracking, or specialized nudge systems.
*   **Seamless Multi-Platform Experience:**
    *   **Status:** In Progress
    *   **Justification:** The monorepo with `apps/mobile` and `apps/server`, and `packages/core` for shared logic, directly supports this. Offline-first design and synchronization are advanced aspects; current progress on these is unclear without deeper inspection.

## Development Roadmap Progress

Based on `project-details.mdc`:

*   **Phase 1: Core Experience:**
    *   **Progress:** In Progress. The basic conversational interface is not explicitly visible but local storage (implied by state management choices) and basic calendar integration (`packages/core/api/calendarEvents.ts`) show progress.
*   **Phase 2: Knowledge Management:**
    *   **Progress:** In Progress. Rich text notes are not confirmed, but the presence of `packages/core/api/notes.ts` indicates foundational work for note management. AI organization and semantic search are likely future tasks within this phase.
*   **Phase 3: Advanced Scheduling:**
    *   **Progress:** Not Started / Early Stages. While basic calendar features are being built (Phase 1), NLP for calendar, goal tracking, and smart notifications are more advanced and likely not yet implemented.
*   **Phase 4: Emotional Intelligence:**
    *   **Progress:** Not Started. No clear evidence of work on sentiment analysis, personalized motivation, etc.

## Suggested Next Steps

1.  **Solidify Core Mobile Structure:** Create the `apps/mobile/src/features/` directory and begin organizing existing mobile code (like notes and calendar functionalities) into feature slices as per the architectural rules. This will improve modularity and scalability.
2.  **Implement Basic Note Creation and Display:** For the "Intelligent Note-Taking" feature, focus on allowing users to create, save (locally, using Zustand with MMKV if planned, or via the backend), and view plain text notes. This builds a tangible piece of Phase 2.
3.  **Set up EAS Build:** If native mobile builds or over-the-air updates are anticipated soon, create the `eas.json` configuration file and set up basic build profiles. This addresses a deviation noted in the architectural adherence section.

This status report is based on the provided documentation and a high-level view of the codebase structure. Deeper code analysis would be required for a more granular assessment.
